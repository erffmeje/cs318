        <p> She was a sour, spiteful creature. The wrinkles of contempt crossed the wrinkles of peevishness, and made her
        face as full of wrinkles as a pat of butter. If ever a king could be justified in forgetting anybody, this
        king was justified in forgetting his sister, even at a christening. She looked very odd, too. Her forehead
        was as large as all the rest of her face, and projected over it like a precipice. When she was angry, her
        little eyes flashed blue. When she hated anybody, they shone yellow and green. What they looked like when
        she loved anybody, I do not know; for I never heard of her loving anybody but herself, and I do not think
        she could have managed that if she had not somehow got used to herself. But what made it highly imprudent
        in the king to forget her was that she was awfully clever. In fact, she was a witch; and when she bewitched
        anybody, he very soon had enough of it; for she beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness, and all the clever
        ones in cleverness. She despised all the modes we read of in history, in which offended fairies and witches
        have taken their revenges; and therefore, after waiting and waiting in vain for an invitation, she made up
        her mind at last to go without one, and make the whole family miserable, like a princess as she was.</p>
